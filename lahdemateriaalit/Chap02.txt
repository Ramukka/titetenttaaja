Introduction

2.1

▪ This lecture outlines the basics of Electrical Circuits
▪ For most students much of this will be familiar
– this lecture can be seen as a revision session for
this material

▪ If there are any topics that you are unsure of (or that
are new to you) you should get to grips with this
material before the next lecture
– the following lectures will assume a basic
understanding of these topics

▪ We will return to look at several of these topics in
more detail in later lectures

Electrical Circuits

2.4

▪ Electric charge
– an amount of electrical energy
– can be positive or negative

▪ Electric current
– a flow of electrical charge, often a flow of electrons
– conventional current is in the opposite direction to a
flow of electrons

▪ Current flow in a circuit
– a sustained current needs a complete circuit
– also requires a stimulus to cause the charge to flow

Electrical Circuits
▪ Electromotive force and potential difference
– the stimulus that causes a current to flow is an e.m.f.
– this represents the energy introduced into the circuit by
a battery or generator
– this results in an electric potential at each point in the
circuit
– between any two points in the circuit there may exist a
potential difference
– both e.m.f. and potential difference are measured in
volts

Electrical Circuits
▪ Voltage reference points
– all potentials within a circuit must be measured with
respect to some other point
– we often measure voltages with respect to a zero volt
reference called the ground or earth

Electrical Circuits
▪ Representing voltages in circuit diagrams
– conventions vary around the world
– we normally use an arrow, which is taken to represent
the voltage on the head with respect to the tail
– labels represent voltages with respect to earth

Direct Current and Alternating Current

2.5

▪ Currents in electrical circuits may be constant or may
vary with time
▪ When currents vary with time they may be
unidirectional or alternating
▪ When the current flowing in a conductor always flows
in the same direction this is direct current (DC)
▪ When the direction of the current periodically
changes this is alternating current (AC)

Resistors, Capacitors and Inductors

2.6

▪ Resistors provide resistance
– they oppose the flow of electricity
– measured in Ohms ()

▪ Capacitors provide capacitance
– they store energy in an electric field
– measured in Farads (F)

▪ Inductors provide inductance
– they store energy in a magnetic field
– measured in Henry (H)

▪ We will look at each component in later lectures

Ohm’s Law

2.7

▪ The current flowing in a conductor is directly
proportional to the applied voltage V and inversely
proportional to its resistance R
V = IR
I = V/R
R = V/I

Kirchhoff’s Current Law

2.8

▪ At any instant the algebraic sum of the currents
flowing into any junction in a circuit is zero
▪ For example
I1 – I2 – I3 = 0
I2 = I1 – I3
= 10 – 3
=7A

Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law

2.8

▪ At any instant the algebraic sum of the voltages
around any loop in a circuit is zero
▪ For example
E – V1 – V2 = 0
V1 = E – V2
= 12 – 7
= 5V

Power Dissipation in Resistors

2.9

▪ The instantaneous power dissipation P of a resistor is
given by the product of the voltage across it and the
current passing through it. Combining this result with
Ohm’s law gives:
P = VI

P = I2R
P = V2/R

Resistive Potential Dividers

2.12

▪ General case

V = V2 + (V1 − V2 )

R2
R1 + R2

Resistive Potential Dividers
▪ Example
R2
V = V2 + (V1 − V2 )
R1 + R2
R2
= 10
R1 + R2

300
= 10
200 + 300
= 6V

Resistive Potential Dividers
▪ Example

V = V2 + (V1 − V2 )

= 3 + 12

R2
R1 + R2

500
1000 + 500

= 3+4
= 7V

2.13

▪ Length of time between corresponding points in
successive cycles is the period T
▪ Number of cycles per second is the frequency f
▪ f = 1/T
